# Handwritten-Digits-Classification-using-Neural-Networks
- Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network on the MNIST dataset and evaluated its performance in classifying handwritten digits using Python  - Upon testing the network to classify the hand written digits in the training set, validation set and the test set, the network gave a high accuracy of 95% approx. within 60sec.  - The regularization of the network is implemented using the regularization coefficient which avoids the over fitting problem.
